## Testing Program

This repository includes a `main.c` file which acts as a test suite for the provided asm functions  
By running the tests, users can visually compare the output against expected results, verifying the correct operation of each function

To run the tests:
```bash
make test
```
---

### Note
In main.c, the test strings are hardcoded for demonstration purposes  
To test different strings, simply change the string literals passed in the main function. For example:

```c
test_strlen("your_custom_string");
test_strcpy("your test string");
... etc
```
